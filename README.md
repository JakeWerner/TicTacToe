# TicTacToe

A TicTacToe game created with two separate accounts to demonstrate competancy with git and distributed version control

DISCLAIMER: Since I could not find a partner for this exercise in time, I used a secondary github account to fulfill the role of having a partner so I could continue to do all of the collaboration steps.
